hahaha, well, this was hard. a super busy day meant i got cut short,
but still want to push something out anyways. i spent most of my time
trying to learn how to make a slideshow (with multiple failed
attempts), then downgraded to making a simple photo grid. even that
proved to be harder than i thought!

i learned a bunch, but itâ€™s kinda hard to tell from how wacky this
looks. oh well. was fun to look at dogs eating ice cream.
